## Project thoughts

I am interested in exploring data related to climate change. There are so many questions to still be answered regarding the impacts of climate change; I think some that might be especially interesting to look into would be the migration patterns of areas that are most at risk for climate related disasters, or potentially the instances of health related impacts of climate change, both negative and positive. Some research has showed that the rate of respiratory illness will go down as we shift towards cleaner energy, but there still might be other negative impacts on health from climate change. Another interesting question to answer will be the effect of more frequent and more intense heat waves on agriculture and/or life expectancy.
